🧠 Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
A complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn, extract business insights, and save outputs like confusion matrix, EDA charts, and trained model artifacts for deployment or integration.

🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a key metric for business sustainability. This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using historical data from a telecom company. Early detection allows businesses to take corrective action and reduce churn rates.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
Joblib (Model Persistence)
Google Collab / Python Script
GitHub

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overall churn rate: ~26.5%
Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more
Tenure, Internet service type, and contract type show strong correlation with churn

📈 Visualizations saved:

correlation_heatmap.png

🔧 Feature Engineering
Dropped customerID
Converted categorical features using get_dummies
Converted Churn column to binary (Yes = 1, No = 0)
Ensured consistent feature columns saved (model_columns.joblib)
Split into train-test (80-20)

🤖 Model Building & Evaluation
Model	Accuracy
Random Forest- 80%

✅ Final model: Random Forest
✅ Class imbalance handled using class_weight='balanced'
✅ Trained model saved as churn_model.joblib

📌 Confusion Matrix

Also saved in repo as confusion_matrix.png.

📁 Output Artifacts
churn_model.joblib → Trained ML model
model_columns.joblib → Feature list for inference
X_test.csv, y_test.csv → Testing data for validation
.png → Visualizations for EDA and evaluation

📈 Business Insights
Customers with short tenure are much more likely to churn.
Contract Type, Tech Support, and Monthly Charges are major indicators.
Targeted offers or improved service in those areas could improve retention.

🚀 Next Steps
Add Streamlit dashboard for prediction
Use SHAP or LIME for interpretability
Schedule retraining with latest data
Deploy model as an API or web app
